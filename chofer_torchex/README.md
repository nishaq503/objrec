This repository is still **under developement**, however, you're more than invited to try stuff :).

# chofer_torchex

In this repository I gather my extensions to [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org). 
The packaging structure tries to reproduce PyTorch's structure in order 
to facilitate usage for people familiar with PyTorch. 

[Read the docs!](https://c-hofer.github.io/chofer_torchex/)

The folder *tutorials* contains some minimalistic examples in form of Jupyter notebooks
to demonstrate how to use the `PyTorch` extensions.
